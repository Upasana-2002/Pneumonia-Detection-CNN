This project focuses on building a deep learning model that can automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a serious lung infection, and radiologists usually examine chest X-rays to identify it. The idea of this project was to see how well a machine learning model can help in this task.

Project Objectives
To classify chest X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia cases.

To apply image preprocessing and understand how it improves model accuracy.

To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.

To evaluate model performance and visualize the results.
